# Contributing to WordPress Project Boilerplate

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the WordPress Project Boilerplate repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature, improvement, or fix.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** or **develop** branch.

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate
feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allows us to
review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests should follow the [PER Coding Style][per-coding-style] and
must adhere to the [Human Made][phpcs-neutron-standard] and
[WordPress][phpcs-wordpress-standard] coding standards.
